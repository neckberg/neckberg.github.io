# neckberg

**neckberg** is a web developer, who likes these things:

- javascript
- markdown
- inline-block css (except it'd be better if there was a whitespace-ignore setting, and if you could make sibling heights the same, like with flex-box)
- preferential voting
- pure html/javascript sites

and a lot more!
